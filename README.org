WIP of the complete frontend rewrite in vanilla JS

Admin section:
- [-] router:
  - [-] backend
  - [ ] settings => DOING
  - [ ] logs
  - [ ] about
  - [ ] setup
  - [X] middleware admin only -> missing notification on error, but is that really needed? probably not
  - [ ] middleware error page
  - [X] middleware side menu
  - [ ] login page => DOING
- [ ] not found page
- [ ] other
  - [ ] side bar
  - [ ] form
  - [ ] error page


End user section:
- [-] router:
  - [ ] home
  - [ ] share
  - [ ] login
  - [ ] viewer
  - [ ] files
  - [ ] tags
  - [ ] logout
  - [-] admin
    - [ ] backend
    - [ ] settings => DOING
    - [ ] logs
    - [ ] about
    - [ ] setup
    - [X] middleware admin only -> missing notification on error, but is that really needed? probably not
    - [ ] middleware error page
    - [X] middleware side menu
    - [ ] login page => DOING
  - [ ] not found page
